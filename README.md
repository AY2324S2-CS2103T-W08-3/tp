* This is **a project to help make it easy to manage our contacts**.<br>
  Example usages:
  * recall a classmate's project role
  * schedule a meeting with a study group
* The project aims to alleviate the common challenge of remembering and managing the myriad of connections we accumulate, especially in academic and professional settings.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `Student Contact Manager` because it helps to store contact details.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Student Contact Manager Website](https://ay2324s2-cs2103t-w08-3.github.io/tp/)**.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
