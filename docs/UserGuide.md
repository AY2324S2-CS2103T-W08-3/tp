# Student Contact Manager User Guide

Hi there! Welcome to our user guide for Student Contact Manager, a student-designed application made for busy university students who are in need of managing their daily activities. It contains many features that help with the management of contacts and events, such as adding, deleting, editing, viewing, and finding of contacts, as well as adding, deleting, editing, viewing, and listing ongoing events. The application also helps with importing and exporting of contacts for better portability.

This user guide aims to aid you in your usage of our application, as well as to explore its various features that can help you manage your own daily activities. To navigate the application, you can use the table of contents placed below. There are also links posted throughout the application that lead back to the table of contents to ease navigability.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your computer.
    * To check whether you have the above installed, open the terminal on your device, and then run `java -version`.

2. Download the latest `scm.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-W08-3/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for Student Contact Manager.

4. Open a command terminal, change the directory (`cd`) into the folder you put the `.jar` file in, and use the `java -jar scm.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

5. Type the command you want to run inside the command box and press `Enter` to execute it. As an example, typing `help` and pressing `Enter` will open the help window.<br>
   There are some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Student Contact Manager.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format and application:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
  * **Note**: Sometimes, commands require the presence of at least one optional item. This will be made clear in the description of each individual command.

* Items with `...` after them can be used multiple times, including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG] ...` can be used as ` ` (i.e., 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family`, etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

* The application is only able to work properly using ASCII characters (i.e., standard characters found on an English keyboard). The use of other character sets is currently unsupported.

* All commands are case-sensitive. As an example, listing contacts requires the `list` command (with all lowercase characters). Variants such as `LIST` or `List` will not be accepted by the application.
